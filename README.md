# SGLib

This is a framework for building games.
It manages the OpenGL context, image loading, audio decoding, and text rendering.
A lot of the functionality in this framework is redundant with other frameworks like LibSDL.

You are not expected to care about this framework.
I use it for Ludum Dare.
